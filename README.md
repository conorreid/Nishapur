# Nishapur
This is an examination of the output of the Samanid mint of Nishapur.
This data comes from an as of yet unpublished volume of coin hoards by Roman K. Kovalev.
The range of this study runs from coins from 279 AH to 387 AH; roughly 100 years.
Tthe coins were found in hoards across Eurasia, and are labeled appropriately.
For all the coins whose weights we did not have, we averaged weights of the leader.
We took out all the coins without leaders for the purpose of this examinination.
The dates will be report in Hegira rather than Gregorian.
This is for the purpose of math, for Hegira dates when converted to Gregorin look like xxx/xx rather than just a straight year.
Therefore, the dates of both the coin and TPQ (deposit date) will be AH.
